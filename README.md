sakai-help-files-download
=========================

Download Sakai help content (in either HTML or Screensteps format) for local customization. 


HTML format
-----------

If you are not using Screensteps, the HTML files can be placed into your $SAKAI_HOME/sakai/help dir and then can be edited manually.


Screensteps format
------------------

The Screensteps package (.scstpkg) files can be imported into an existing Screensteps account for editing.

To export modified content out of Screensteps and back into Sakai, you will first need to download the Screensteps-Sakai-HTML-Export-Template.zip file and extract its contents to the html templates directory in the Screensteps program folder. This will allow you to select the "Sakai" html template when exporting from Screensteps.

For more information on installing custom export templates in Screensteps, please refer to: http://help.screensteps.com/m/11035/l/117468-installing-a-custom-html-template 

Please see https://github.com/LongsightGroup/sakai-help-conversion for more information on how to translate Screensteps HTML exports into HTML formatted for Sakai's help system.
